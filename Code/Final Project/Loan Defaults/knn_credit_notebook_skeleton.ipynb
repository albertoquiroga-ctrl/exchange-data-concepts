Executive Summary (objective + deliverables)\n**Objective.** Train and validate a supervised KNN classifier to estimate applicants' default probability and make approve/decline decisions that **maximize expected profit** under a business cost/benefit matrix.  \n**Deliverables.** 1) KNN model encapsulated in a reproducible pipeline, 2) operating threshold optimized for utility, 3) holdout test evaluation with technical metrics and **business utility**, 4) deployment and monitoring guidelines.  \n**Success criterion.** Beat baselines (approve all / approve none) in net utility; keep risk metrics aligned with policy (e.g., minimum TPR on a priority segment).  \n**Key assumptions.** Use case: credit decision for existing customers (historical information available) with target \"default next period.\" Costs and benefits are provided by the business (or scenario-based here).  \n**Limitations.** KNN is sensitive to scaling, dimensionality, and inference latency; mitigated via preprocessing, k selection, and production controls."

Problem statement\nAt application time, the bank wants a system that **predicts default risk** and decides approve/decline to maximize financial utility.

Demographics, credit limit, recent payment history, billed amounts, and previous payments. Binary label: `default_payment_next_month` (1=default, 0=no default).  \nVariable groups:  \n- Demographics/profile: `LIMIT_BAL`, `SEX`, `EDUCATION`, `MARRIAGE`, `AGE`.  \n- Payment history: `PAY_0` ... `PAY_6` (recent monthly status).  \n- Billed amounts: `BILL_AMT1` ... `BILL_AMT6`.  \n- Paid amounts: `PAY_AMT1` ... `PAY_AMT6`.  \n- Target: `default_payment_next_month`.\n\n### 1.3.

Cost/benefit matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)\nDefinitions:  \n- **TP**: approve a non-defaulter → benefit = expected margin (interest − cost of funds − provisions) minus operating costs.  \n- **FP**: approve a defaulter → cost = expected loss (principal × LGD − recoveries) + expenses.  \n- **TN**: reject a defaulter → benefit/cost ≈ 0, or benefit from avoided losses.  \n- **FN**: reject a good customer → opportunity cost (foregone margin).\n\n### 2.2. Expected value function and optimal decision threshold\nFor estimated default probability $\\\\hat{p}$, expected **utility** of approval is:\n$$\nU(\\\\text{approve}) = (1-\\\\hat{p}) \\\\cdot B_{\\\\text{TP}} - \\\\hat{p} \\\\cdot C_{\\\\text{FP}}\n$$\nand of **reject**:\n$$\nU(\\\\text{reject}) = (1-\\\\hat{p}) \\\\cdot (-C_{\\\\text{FN}}) + \\\\hat{p} \\\\cdot B_{\\\\text{TN}}\n$$\nDefine the **optimal threshold** $\\\\tau^*$ such that approve if $U(\\\\text{approve}) \\\\ge U(\\\\text{reject})$. This threshold is not necessarily 0.5 and depends on the cost/benefit matrix.\n\n### 2.3.
